# Hangman_game
Project Title: Python Hangman GameDescription:The "Python Hangman Game" is a text-based word-guessing game where players try to discover a hidden word by suggesting individual letters. The game provides a visual representation of the player's progress and the number of incorrect guesses through a hangman drawing.Key Features:Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player's task is to guess the letters in that word.Visual Hangman: The game incorporates a visual hangman figure that evolves with each incorrect guess, creating a sense of tension and challenge for the player.Word Progress: Players are presented with an initially blank word with underscores representing the unguessed letters. Correct guesses fill in the blanks, allowing players to track their progress.User Interaction: The player inputs single letters as guesses, and the game provides feedback on whether the letter is in the hidden word or not.Game Loop: The game allows for continuous play with the option to start a new round with a different word.Usage:To play the Hangman game, run the Python script. Follow the on-screen instructions to input single letters as your guesses. The hangman figure evolves as incorrect guesses are made. Your goal is to guess the word before the hangman is completely drawn.Significance:Hangman is a classic word game that is both fun and educational. This project demonstrates how to create a simple text-based game with a graphical element, making it a valuable resource for those interested in game development and Python programming.
